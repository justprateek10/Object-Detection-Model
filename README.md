This project implements an object detection pipeline using deep learning frameworks. It allows you to train and test a custom object detection model to identify and localize objects in images.

Features
✅ Train an object detection model on a labeled dataset
✅ Support for custom object classes
✅ Inference on test images with bounding boxes and class labels
✅ Visualization of detection results
✅ Configurable hyperparameters and data paths

Tech Stack
Python 3

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch if extended)

NumPy

Matplotlib

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/justprateek10/Object-Detection-Model.git
cd Object-Detection-Model
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If requirements.txt is not yet present, you can create it after installing packages manually with pip freeze > requirements.txt.)

4. Prepare your data
Place your training images in data/train/

Place your testing images in data/test/

Update any annotation files (like XML/JSON/COCO format) if required by your training pipeline.

5. Train the model
python train.py
6. Test the model
python test.py
Usage
Once trained, the model will save weights to the models/saved_model/ directory. You can then use test.py to perform inference on new images, drawing bounding boxes and labels automatically.

Possible Improvements
✅ Add more annotation formats (e.g., COCO, YOLO)
✅ Extend to video object detection
✅ Add mAP (mean Average Precision) evaluation
✅ Use transfer learning with a pretrained backbone (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)
✅ Deploy as a Flask or FastAPI microservice
